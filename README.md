# This is basically my first Unity Game.
This is not currently done. All I have is the basic framework for the Menu and non-interactable moving water.

This is a recreation of a pong game [I made in scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1012057446) a while ago. I am recreating it as some practice for Unity.
